          Hello! My name is Juliette Mangon. I am a 20-year-old originally from Lexington, MA, and I currently reside in New York City. I am deeply passionate about sustainability and climate change—a commitment that inspired me to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle in the seventh grade after learning about the environmental impact of the meat industry. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a creative side; I enjoy painting, drawing, and exploring various art mediums, with acrylic painting being my favorite. My artistic interests not only provide a creative outlet but also fuel my creativity, encouraging me to think more imaginatively and approach challenges with fresh, innovative perspectives.

  <div class="educational-background">
    <p>
      I am currently a student at New York University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Business of Entertainment, Media, and Technology, and I am set to graduate in December 2025. My passion for mathematics naturally led me to computer science, a field that captured my interest during my first programming course in high school. While I have always been drawn to the analytical and problem-solving aspects of these disciplines, I initially found it challenging to define a specific career path amidst the diverse opportunities available.
    </p>
    <p>
      A transformative course on media and entertainment last spring opened my eyes to the creative possibilities within the tech industry. This experience not only broadened my academic perspective but also resonated with my lifelong passion for painting and creative expression. My artistic interests not only provide a creative outlet but also fuel my creativity, encouraging me to think more imaginatively and approach challenges with fresh, innovative perspectives.
