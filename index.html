    <h3 class="about-title">Educational Background</h3>
    <div class="about-me">
        <p>Hello! My name is Juliette Mangon. I am a student at New York University pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics with a minor in Business of Entertainment, Media, and Technology, graduating in December 2025. I have always enjoyed math, and became just as passionate about computer science when I took my first programming class my sophomore year of highschool. Despite my love for these subjects, I couldn't visualize an exact career path for myself, given the vast range of fields that one can enter with this degree. In turn, I took a course on media and entertainment industries last spring and was pleasantly surprised, leading me to add my minor. Now, I am interested in a more creative side of computer science, maybe in media.</p>

    <h3 class="about-title">About me</h3>
    <div class="about-me">
        <p>I am 20 years old and was raised in Lexington, MA but I now live in New York City. I am very passionate about sustainability and the climate change, and became vegetarian in 7th grade after learning about the meat industry's impact on the environment. In my free time I like to paint and draw and explore different art mediums, and I have found acrylic painting to be my favorite.</p>
